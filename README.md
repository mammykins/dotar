Dota 2 also has a widespread and active competitive scene, with teams from across the world playing professionally in various leagues and tournaments.  
Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of dollars, the highest of any eSport.

## Competetive edge

Dota 2 is a strategic game dependent on optimising decision making as well as refined mechanics. To aid both amateurs and professionals alike, I have developed a package of functions to assist in making informed decisions. 

## Dota 2 is complicated

Dota 2 has some complex mechanics, the underlying mathematics is straightforward but difficult to calculate on the-fly and using mental arithmetic. Thus this package allows quick minimisation and then basic decision making to made quickly while in-game.

## Effective hp app

I developed a Shiny app that I recently archived as it was incomplete. However, if people are interested I can share this code and make it available on-line again.

## Helping new players

This complexity can put off new players, thus this package aids user uptake by allowing players to quickly work out how much their Finger of Death will do at level 1 (`mag_dam(600)` = 390 hp).
